        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <h5>
            My great, great, great grandmother was first found by Carle Gessard in 1882. He was a French military physician who was 
            studying the blue-green pus he saw in soldiers on the battlefield.<br><br>

            I'm quite popular around the hospital I work in and you can find me usually within post-surgical wounds as a member of 
            the NI/HAI team.<br><br>

            I've also been found in a pathogenic form on Phaseolus vulgaris, or the common bean, in Kenya since 2019. I'm also in 
            eyedrops manufactured by EzriCare and Delsam Pharma in 2022 and 2023.<br><br>

            People have tried getting rid of me using carbapenems, polymyxins, and tigecycline, but I've been starting to develop 
            resistance to these antiobiotics as well. I can be removed from wounds with acetic acids with concentrations of 
            0.5%-5%.<br><br>

            Microscopically, I am Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and respirate aerobically, but I can also do so anaerobically if need be. 
            I move using flagellum, usually with a singular flagella, but I can also have 2-3. I also have pili that can attach onto 
            different surfaces. My low-permeability cellular envelope has lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane that is actually 
            less toxic than other Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria.<br><br>

            My colonies appear in a range of colors, from blue-green to yellow to red to brown. They're usually large and round with 
            irregular margins but a flat surface. My colonies may also have a shiny surface due to the biofilm I produce, see 
            <a href="projects.html">my projects</a>!
