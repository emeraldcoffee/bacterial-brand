# bacterial-brand

I made this project for my high school Medical Microbiology class in 2024. We were tasked with creating a website with branding for a certain bacteria---I, wanting to be a little bit extra, chose to create my own website from scratch instead of using a premade website builder. 
The process was quite fun! I got to experiment with HTML and CSS, something that I haven't done since 8th grade, playing around with formatting and creating multiple pages, while also learning about what Pseudomonas aeruginosa is and does.

Thank you to Dr. LeBlanc for assigning us this project! I had a ton of fun with it :)
